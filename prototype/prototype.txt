It creates new objects, but rather than creating non-initialized objects it returns objects that are
initialized with values it copied from a prototype/object.
It is also referred to as Properties patter

USES
  - An example where this can be useful is the initialization of business objects with values that match the default
    values in the database.
  - The prototype object holds the default values that are copied over to newly created business objects

PARTICIPANTS
1. Client
  - creates a new object by asking a prototype to clone itself

2. Prototype
  - creates an interface to clone itself

3. Clones
  - the cloned objects that are being created

JS CAN DO THIS FAR MORE EFFECTIVELY USING THE BUILT-IN PROTOTYPE FACILITY
