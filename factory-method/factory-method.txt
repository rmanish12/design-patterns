It creates a new object as instructed by the client.
One way to create an object in JS is through new operator. However, there are situations where the client does not,
or should not, know which one of several candidae objects to instantiate.
The factory method allows the client to delegate object creation while still retaining control over which type to
instantiate.

USES:
  - the key objective of Factory method is extensibility. It is commonly used in applications that manage, maintain, 
    or manipulate collections of objects that are different but at the same time have many characteristics in common.
  - E.g, a collection of documents with a mix of XML, PDF and RTF
